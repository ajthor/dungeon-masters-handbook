## Start Here
Learning how to play *Dungeons and Dragons* __(D&D)__ :dragon: can be challenging without a guide. This is meant to be the ultimate guide for aspiring players to learn the ins and outs of actually sitting down to play the game.

> __What is D&D, anyway?__
Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game where players act as characters in an ongoing fantasy story.

## Who Is This DM Guy?
The *Dungeon Master* __(DM)__ or *Game Master* __(GM)__, as they are sometimes known, is in charge of delivering the narrative of the story and in charge of adjudicating the actions of the players to determine if they succeed or fail. Think of the DM as 'fate'. They decide what happens all around you. In D&D, you have free will, but you have no control over anything but yourself. The DM is in charge of everything else.

> __NOTE:__ In D&D, the final ruling on any situation always comes from the DM. The DM's ruling supersedes the *Player's Handbook* __(PHB)__, and whatever the DM says is ultimately the final decision, and this decision should always be respected. If you are unsure about a rule, ask the DM for clarification.

## Dice
Much of the game is decided using dice. To play D&D, you will need a set of dice. Dice come in numerous varieties, and with different numbers of sides. We describe the number of sides a die has using a shorthand notation of *'d'*. A 6-sided die, for example is called a __d6__. Similarly, a 20-sided die is called a __d20__. When multiple dice are rolled, we put the number of dice before the *'d'* in the shorthand notation. Rolling three 6-sided dice would be called __3d6__.

## Your Character
To begin, you will need to *come up with* a character. In Dungeons and Dragons, you are given a choice at the very beginning as to who you want to play as. This character is how you interact with the world, and your character also determines how you should act inside the game.

> __NOTE:__ The PHB is an excellent resource for figuring out what various *races* and *classes* are available to you for creating your character.

Your character is comprised of three things: their background, their abilities, and their skills. We will cover all of these things individually.

> __NOTE:__ It is important to note, before moving on, that D&D is not a game about winning or losing. There are many chances for success and failure in the game, but there is no way to 'beat' D&D. As such, it is better to come up with a character that portrays a particular personality, first and foremost, than it is to try to make a character that will 'win'.

### Personality
Your character is assumed to have their own personality in D&D, complete with their own backstory and motivations. Your character is a three-dimensional creation, and they should have their own thoughts and make their own decisions, independent of you, the player.

In reality, however, your character will be an extension of your own personality, and you will make decisions on their behalf. This leads to some important points about *meta-gaming* and *player knowledge*.

__Meta-Gaming__ is playing the game using knowledge that you, the player, have about the way the game works. Usually, this is to receive some kind of advantage in the game that you wouldn't normally have if you were playing as your character.

__Player Knowledge__ describes the separation between what *you* know and what *your character* knows. This ties in closely with meta-gaming in that usually it is used to gain some kind of advantage in the situation at hand. It is important to separate your own knowledge about the game and what your character knows. This can be tricky because as you gain experience playing the game, you will learn more about how difficult something is to defeat or what sort of damage a creature might inflict on you, but it is important to separate this knowledge from what your character would know.

Knowing this, it is more important to invent a character's background and personality based on who you want to be in the game, rather than choosing something because it will be the best.

### Consequences And Dying
Over the course of playing the game, your character will likely run into many dangerous situations, any one of which could lead to your character's untimely end. Death is a touchy subject in D&D, and it can often be a difficult event. Players often become very attached to their characters, and when they die, it can be very difficult to cope with.

Similarly, during your adventures, you will probably acquire some very unique items that give you some kind of advantage or provide some unique benefit to your character. In many cases, these items become as much a part of your character as their personality. However, it can happen that items get lost, broken, taken, or stolen from your character, and so you should never be overly upset if something happens to them.

With this in mind, it is important for new players to know that death is a real possibility for your characters, one that could happen at virtually any time. Because of this, you should never become overly attached to your character or to any particular piece of equipment.

### Background
The first step in making your character should be to come up with your character's background. Once you have a personality and a background, the rest is easy. Coming up with this can be as easy as stringing three words together, such as "disgraced pirate captain", or as difficult as writing a ten thousand word essay on your character's raison d'Ãªtre and philosophy on life.

### Race & Class
Once you have an idea for your character, it is important to think about what race your character is. Usually, these two decisions tie in very closely with one another. Take some time to look through the PHB, or, better yet, describe the character you want to be to your DM. They can help you shape your choice to something that fits within the overall narrative.

Once you have come up with your character's personality and their race, you will need to select a class for your character. This decision should come secondary to your decision about a character's personality. Your class is what your character specializes in, it is not who your character is.

> __NOTE:__ Nowhere is it written that a character need only be one class. It is possible to mix and match classes, but doing so requires a firm grasp on the rules in the PHB, and so many characters stick with only one class to start with. There are also many benefits to sticking with one class the whole time.

## The Numbers
Now we get to the numbers game that is D&D. So you've come up with a character and have an idea of *who they are*. Now, you need to figure out *what they can do*.

We will finally get to the bread and butter of D&D, the __Character Sheet__. Every character's skills and abilities can be represented by the information presented on the character sheet. Much of the information on the sheet is categorized for easy reference, but at first it will take some getting used to.

### Ability Scores
The first and most important part of what describes your character on the character sheet are what are called *Ability Scores*, and these are mostly decided through chance. This information is going to describe your character's abilities in the game and give you an idea of what they are good at. Ability scores are a numeric value that is usually between 6 and 20, although this is not a hard and fast limit. To give you an idea of what this numeric value actually means, consider that an average person would have an ability score of 10 in every category. An adventurer usually has some skills that far exceed the average person.

The core ability scores that describe every character are:
- Strength __(STR)__: This describes how physically strong your character is. Players with high strength scores are usually warriors, adept at hand-to-hand combat.
- Dexterity __(DEX)__: Dexterity is like agility, and describes how nimble your character is. Players with high dexterity scores usually have good fine motor skills and are usually good with weapons at a distance, like bows and arrows, or with small hand-to-hand weapons, like daggers.
- Constitution __(CON)__: This score is how resilient you are to damage and how 'healthy' you are. Players with high constitution scores usually are harder to kill.
- Intelligence __(INT)__: Intelligence describes what you might call "book learning". A player with a lot of formal study under their belt might have a high intelligence score.
- Wisdom __(WIS)__: Wisdom is what you might call "practical knowledge". A high wisdom score is indicative of someone who has a lot of experience in the wilderness, or who can guess at someone's intentions more easily than others.
- Charisma __(CHA)__: This score describes how good you are at speaking to others. Players who specialize in charisma can persuade others, lie more easily, and bluff their way out of situations better than most.

To determine these ability scores, you will need to roll __4d6__, taking the highest three numbers and adding them up. You can assign this number to any one of these six ability scores. Repeat this process six times to determine all of your ability scores.

> __NOTE:__ The PHB gives a detailed description of how to come up with your character's ability scores if you need further reference. Also, it is important to ask your DM if they have a particular method for determining ability scores.

Once you have completed this portion, take a look at the description for your race, as there will often be a boost to one ability score or another.

Once you have these numbers, you need to calculate your *Ability Score Modifiers*.

> __NOTE:__ __Modifiers__ add a number to a die roll, and either add more to the total or subtract from it. Using the shorthand for dice mentioned above, we denote modifiers as either '+' or '-'. A modifier of __+2__ added to a die roll of __3d6__ would be described as __3d6+2__. You would calculate this by rolling __3d6__, taking the total from the dice, and adding two to that number.

Ability score modifiers are what you will use instead of your actual ability scores. These are the numbers that matter when you actually roll the dice. The ability score modifiers, though, are calculated using your ability scores. To calculate the ability score modifiers, take your ability score, subtract 10, divide by 2, and round up to the nearest whole number. This is what you will write in the large boxes which contain your ability scores on your character sheet.

### Skills
Now that you have your ability scores, we can determine what skills your character has. While ability scores represent overall characteristics of your character, skills represent the specific things your character is good at, and relate to each of the six ability score categories. For example, some skills that relate to charisma are *'persuasion'*, *'intimidation'*, and *'decption'*. Skills are the way you actually make use of your ability scores in most situations.

Skills are usually determined by a number of things, such as your character's race, class, and ability scores, but you do have some say in the matter. This comes in the form of *'proficiencies'*.

Based on your character's race, class, and background, your character will be more 'proficient' in certain skills or with certain weapons or tools. This 'proficiency' grants a numeric bonus when utilizing a skill, weapon or tool you are proficient with. This is known as your character's *proficiency bonus*. This proficiency bonus is a fixed number that is denoted as a modifier.

When you make your character, you will be able to select a few skills which you are proficient in. Refer to the PHB's section for your class to determine which skills you can select as proficiencies.

> __NOTE:__ Once you select your proficiencies, your proficiencies are more or less permanent and will not change.

> __NOTE:__ There is a small circle located next to the skill on your character sheet. Fill in that circle to denote that your character has proficiency in that particular skill. This will help tremendously later on.

Now, you will go through the process of calculating your *skill bonuses*. Next to each skill, there is an indication of what ability score the skill falls under. To calculate your skill bonus, you take the ability score modifier relating to the skill and add your proficiency bonus to it if you have proficiency in that skill. Write the total down in the empty space next to the skill name. Skill bonuses are denoted as modifiers using the modifier notation.

### Level
As you progress in the game, you will gain experience. As you collect this experience, you will inevitably become stronger than you were before. This advancement is represented by your character's *level*. This is an easy way to compare the relative strengths of two characters or to determine if you are strong enough to fight someone.

> __NOTE:__ Each level is also attached to advancement in a particular class. At level one, you select a class which is referred to as your *'base class'*. When you advance to level two, however, you can 'take a level' in another class. Taking a level of another class sometimes requires a minimum ability score related to that class.

As you level up, you will gain higher bonuses to some of your abilities and skills.
