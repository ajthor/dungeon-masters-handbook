## Rolls

<a name="no-unnecessary-rolls"></a>
- [No Unnecessary Rolls](#no-unnecessary-rolls) Only roll when the DM tells you to roll.
  > __WHY?__ Preemptively rolling the dice introduces the possibility of failure in a situation where the DM may have otherwise granted automatic success.

## Combat

<a name="have-your-actions-ready"></a>
- [Have Your Actions Ready](#have-your-actions-ready) Know what you want to do before the start of your turn in combat. Plan out your action beforehand, and ask for more time if you need to look something up in the PHB for clarification. Better yet, look it up before the start of your turn.
  > __WHY?__ Putting the game on pause so that a player can make decisions is the surest way to slow down combat. Knowing what you want to do beforehand keeps the game rolling smoothly.

<a name="know-your-rolls"></a>
- [Know Your Rolls](#know-your-rolls) Memorize which dice you roll for common actions your character can perform. You should memorize your weapon damage rolls, for example.
  > __WHY?__ Looking at your character sheet for common rolls slows the game down, especially in combat.

<a name="know-your-actions"></a>
- [Know Your Actions](#know-your-actions) Know your class features and spell descriptions, and keep an easy reference handy.
  > __WHY?__ Misunderstandings over the effect of a spell or ability happen often. Having the description handy means you won't have to go searching through the PHB if you need to clarify something.
