# DM Standards
-----

A standard for DMing. :dragon:

# Philosophy
The DM is an arbitrator and an adjudicator, as well as a narrator. With these traits in mind, the DM Standards guide is meant to narrow down the function of the DM and provide the services necessary to run a game.

## Combat

<a name="narrative-combat"></a>
- [Narrative Combat](#narrative-combat) Maintain a consistent narrative style, even when in combat.
> __WHY?__

<a name="use-narrative-hooks"></a>
- [Use Narrative Hooks](#use-narrative-hooks) To keep the flow of combat going, use narrative hooks to indicate whose turn is next.
> __WHY?__

<a name="avoid-rolling-initiative"></a>
- [Avoid Rolling Initiative](#avoid-rolling-initiative) Have the players roll initiative only under special circumstances. See: [Track Initiative Privately](#track-initiative-privately).
> __WHY?__ Rolling initiative removes the players from the narrative flow of the game. It also limits the players to using 'combat' abilities rather than leaving open the possibility for more creative decision-making.

<a name="track-initiative-privately"></a>
- [Track Initiative Privately](#track-initiative-privately) Keep track of initiative behind the DM screen to ensure everyone gets a turn in combat.
> __WHY?__ When the players know the initiative order, it encourages meta-gaming, and subtly influences the player's decisions.

<a name="limit-indecision-delay"></a>
- [Limit Indecision Delay](#limit-indecision-delay) Move a player down in the initiative order if they have not decided what they want to do at the start of their turn. Treat player indecisiveness like character indecisiveness. Return to them after every subsequent turn to give them a chance to act. Allow players time to get clarification from the PHB if they need it.
> __WHY?__ Delays due to indecisiveness are some of the most common problems that occur during combat. Encourage your players to act without consulting their character sheet first.
